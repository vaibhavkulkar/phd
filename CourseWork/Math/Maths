Mathematics has many branches, including algebra, geometry, arithmetic, calculus, and probability and statistics. 
	Algebra
		The study of algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces 
		Commutative algebra is a branch of algebra that studies commutative rings and their ideals 
	Geometry 
		The study of shapes and their properties
		Euclidean geometry and non-Euclidean geometry are branches of geometry
	Arithmetic 
		A branch of mathematics that deals with numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
	Calculus 
		The study of the relationship between variables that depend on each other
		Formerly called infinitesimal calculus, it was introduced by Newton and Leibniz
	Probability and statistics 
		The study of random events and their probabilities
		Includes probability theory, statistics, and stochastic processes
	Other branches of mathematics 
		analysis, combinatorics, game theory, number theory, numerical analysis, optimization, set theory, topology, and trigonometry.
		Mathematics is used in many areas of modern life, including business, cooking, and art.
